Dear EDD Representative,I am writing to request assistance in verifying my identity so that I can access the pandemic-related funds that I am still eligible for. During the pandemic, I faced significant challenges, and while I had nearly given up on my eligibility, I was recently informed that I may still qualify for benefits. These funds would make a tremendous difference in my current situation, as I have endured financial hardship over the past few years.

In support of my identity verification, I am enclosing two forms of primary identification and four secondary identification documents, as listed below:

Primary ID Documents:
	1.	Type of Primary ID (e.g., Driverâ€™s License)
	2.	Type of Primary ID (e.g., Passport)
Secondary ID Documents:
	1.	Type of Secondary ID (e.g., Power Bill)
	2.	Type of Secondary ID (e.g., Internet Statement)
	3.	Type of Secondary ID (e.g., Bank Statement)
	4.	Type of Secondary ID (e.g., Verification of Benefits)
I understand the verification process is necessary to prevent fraud, and I am fully cooperative in providing any additional information that may be required. It is essential for me to regain access to these funds, which will help me address financial concerns that remain from the pandemic. I appreciate your timely attention to this matter and hope for a swift resolution.

Please feel free to contact me at Mrlusterd@yahoo.com if any further information is needed to complete my verification.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,
Daniel Luster----------
